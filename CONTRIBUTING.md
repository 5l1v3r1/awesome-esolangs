# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Use the following format: `[language|resource](link) - Description.`
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Additions should be added in alphabetical order of the relevant category.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
* Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* The pull request should have a useful title and include a description on why the language or resource is awesome.
* Any addition MUST have a link. The link should not have trailing slash or unnecessary characters.
* The link must be a direct link, and not shortened, proxy or redirection.
* The link MUST be available (dead links will be removed or changed).
* Check the markdown syntax is correct and properly displayed in GitHub.

## Languages
* Suggested languages should be documented, even if the implementation doesn't exists.
* Only languages considered esoteric are accepted (I'm looking at you, Haskell).
* Additions of your own languages are welcome (if they are awesome and esoteric).
* All links should refer to the original or most relevant web/implementation of the language.
* The link must refer to the original author, documentation or resource of the language if possible.
* The suggestion should be an issue with the reasons why this language is esoteric (and awesome).

## Resources and articles
* Resources must be related to esoteric languages.

## Community
* Communities must be active and specific to the topic of this list


Thank you for your suggestions!
